# A Text Analysis of MLB Performance

## Team members:

-Grigor Tashchyan


## Objective:
The goal of this project is to conduct a text/event analysis of articles and blog posts of certain Major League Baseball (MLB) teams shown on the mlbtraderumors.com website.  From this, we will be comparing and associating the key words that show up in blog posts to team performance.  Performance of teams will be measured by attendance, wins and losses, and team revenue.  We are looking for which of these events are most likely to lead to increase or decrease in overall team performance. The use of this analysis would provide team leadership insight into whether current article and blog posts are typically associated with a winning or losing MLB team.
