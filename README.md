# AppliedTextMining_Team11

## Objective:
Our projectâ€™s objective will involve a sentiment/event analysis of articles/blogposts shown on the mlbtraderumors.com website.  We will be comparing the key words that show up in blog posts to team performance.  Performance will be measured in attendance, wins/losses, and team revenue.  We are looking for which reported on events are most likely to lead to increases or decreases in overall team performance.
